# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation

The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify distinct groups of customers based on their buying behavior.

# Problem Description:
In this project, your task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

# Step used for Analysis:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. RFM
4. Clustering
5. Cluster Profiling
6. Conclusion
# Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) model to determine customer value:
The RFM model is quite useful model in retail customer segmentation where only the data of customer transaction is available. RFM stands for the three dimensions:

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase? - Number of days since last purchase
Frequency – How often do they purchase? - The total number of purchases
Monetary Value – How much do they spend? - The total money customer spent
A combination of these three attributes can be defined to assign a quantitative value to customers. e.g. A customer who recently bought high value products and transacts regularly is a high value customer.



Model used for analysis
K-Means Clustering
Silhouette Analysis
Elbow Method
DBSCAN Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Agglomerative Clustering (Bottom-up approach using tree like diagram called Dendogram)
Conclusion
RFM(Recency, Frequency and Monetary) dataframe ease our problem to solve in a particular order, it makes easy to recommend and display new launched products to few customers.
And total number clusters for each of the used models came 2.
